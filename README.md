# Class12-Prompt-206

Tell us about something you learned this week.
  I learned that an algorithm is a function that transforms a certain input data structure into a certain output data structure.

What are the pros and cons of immutability?
  An immutable object is thread-safe; they cannot be corrupted by multiple threads accessing them concurrently.

How can you achieve immutability in your own code?
  Immutable data cannot change its structure or data in it

What are Divide and Conquer algorithms? Describe how they work. Can you give any common examples of the types of problems where this approach might be used?
  It is a strategy of solving a large problem by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. An example of this is binary search or quick sort.

How do insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort work?
  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is split into a sorted and unsorted part.
  
  Heap sort- is a comparision based sorting technique based on binary heap data structure. 
  
  Quick sort- is the best sort technique because it's a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partions the given array around the picked pivot.
  
  Merge sort- like quick sort, merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sortes halves.
    

What are the key advantages of insertion sort, quick sort, heap sort and merge sort? Discuss best, average, and worst case time and memory complexity.
  They all help you solve a problem. The best ones to use are quick sort and merge sort.


Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.
  Mutable objects can change their state or contents and immutable objects can't change their state or content.

What are the three laws of algorithm recursion? Describe them in your own words and what they mean to you.
  A recursive algorithm must have a base case, must change its state and move toward the base case, and it must call itself recursively.
  A base case is usually a problem that is small enough to solve directly.
  A change of state means that some data that the algorithn is using is modified.
  The final law is that the algorithm must call itself.
